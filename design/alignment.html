        <h2>Google</h2>
        <h2>How it is Used</h2>
        <p>While I feel that I have seen many mobile sites with strong alignment, Google is one that stood out to me. Most sites have just a left alignment, but Google has created one on both the right and the left. Most of the sites that are linked here on its main page have images along side of them to help create the justified alignment feel. All the text is aligned to the left and the images help the uneven mess of words on the right, creating a strong right alignment as well. When there isn't an image to help balance the justification, then there are buttons such as "Got it" or "Learn more" that are right aligned.</p>
        <p>This alignment that Google has created makes a very visually appealing site and makes it also easy to navigate.</p>
